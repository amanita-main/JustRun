# JustRun

JustRun is an open-source project for tracking your training activity.

#Motivation

There is a lot of tracking applications, but some apps is not free or with limited functionality.
This application inspired by free application Nike+, but there no notifications about heart rate, only monitoring, no export gpx  tracks or export data to other platforms (strava, google fit, etc).
Also I'd like to get a good experience in Android development, therefore why not. Just for fun. 

#Current state

Early development stage.
Since 6 Jan 2018 to middle of Feb I will be in a trip without laptop, therefore development will be paused.

#Installation

Download/Clone repository and open in Android Studio
