# JustRun

JustRun is an open-source project for tracking your training activity.

#Motivation

There is a lot of tracking applications, but some apps is not free or with limited functionality.
This application inspired by free application Nike+, but there no notifications about heart rate, only monitoring, no export gpx  tracks or export data to other platforms (strava, google fit, etc).
Also I'd like to get a good experience in Android development, therefore why not. Just for fun.

#Planned features

- Recording gps tracks
- Training history and plans, sync with some cloud platforms (at least support sync with google)
- Sharing, exporting storing data
- Ble heart rate monitor support with training range support, may be also other sensors, like cadence, some smart watches with sensors, etc
- Support other trainings like bicycle, ski, etc

#Current state
